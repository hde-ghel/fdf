# FdF 

A simple 3D height-map renderer. Color are defined by
relative height in the map.

## Preview
Screenshot will be added.

## Features
* Simple file format definition (array of space-separated integers defining height of each point)
* Different view modes (iso, parallel, pyramid, flat)
* 3D rotations
* Camera controls (zoom, move : up, down, right, left)
* Pretty color gradients!
* Color modification
* Height modification

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Currently running on OS X and linux.

Run it with `./fdf [map]`. A bunch of sample maps are provided in the `test_maps`
directory.

Controls can be found on the menu inside de program.
